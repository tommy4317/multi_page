    <h3>Cielito Lindo Revisited</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>My father never spoke much Spanish around the house,
        <br/> 
        never really talked a lot about our heritage
        <br/>
        Until the day I traded Bobby Ames 
        <br/>
        my two favorite Hot Wheels cars 
        <br/>
        for his red, plastic, 
        <br/>
        Frito Bandito erasers. 
        <br/>
        My little brother and I shoved them onto our fingers, 
        <br/>
        strapped belts around our chests like bandoleras,
        <br/>
        danced around our bedroom singing:
        <br/><br/>
        
        <em>“Ay, ay, ay, ay
        <br/>
        I am the Frito Bandito
        <br/>
        Give me Frito Corn Chips and I be your friend
        <br/>
        The Frito Bandito you must not offend...”</em>
        <br/><br/>
        Until Dad burst through the door shouting:
        <br/>
        <em>“What the hell are you doing!”</em>
        <br/><br/>
        
        He took one look at us trying to be Mexicans, 
        <br/>
        sat down and explained that funny little Frito Bandito 
        <br/>
        had been modeled after Pancho Villa and Emiliano Zapata, 
        <br/>
        men who had died fighting for their country.
        <br/>
        He told us the story of Zapata’s ghost 
        <br/>
        riding through the hillsides of Morelos shouting,
        <br/><br/>
        <em>“Tierra Y Libertad!”</em> 
        <br/>
        Land and Freedom
        <br/><br/>
        
        The Frito jingle 
        <br/>
        had been stolen from a love song, 
        <br/>
        a man singing to a dark eyed girl from the mountains, 
        <br/>
        a woman who was so beautiful
        <br/>
        birds would gladly abandon their nests 
        <br/>
        so that her beauty could take their place.
        <br/>
        He told us that some nights his Father sang that song to his Mother
        <br/>
        then he stood up and began to sing Cielito Lindo.
        <br/>
        We stared in wide-eyed amazement 
        <br/>
        as Spanish echoed off our bedroom walls. 
        <br/>
        As his heart reached back to Mexico.
        <br/>
        At the end of that song, 
        <br/>
        he slipped those erasers off our fingers without a fight,
        <br/>
        quietly left the room.
        <br/>
        That night, I swore I could 
        <br/>
        hear the hooves of Zapata’s horse outside my window
        <br/>
        and in the darkness my little brother whispered
        <br/>
        <em>“I hear them too.”</em> 
        <br/><br/>
        
        I won’t let my own children watch Speedy Gonzalez cartoons.
        <br/>
        That peòn dressed rat who always saves the 
        <br/>
        run-down border town from the gringo gato
        <br/>
        because, as one mouse lounging under his sombrero, 
        <br/>
        leaning against an adobe wall tells the other one,
        <br/>
        <em>“He likes my seester”</em>
        <br/><br/>
        
        I’d like to grill up the Taco Bell chihuahua fajita-style
        <br/>
        sprinkle it with salt and limòn, 
        <br/>
        top it with whatever the hell their “Spicy Pepper Jack” sauce is
        <br/>
        and shove it down the throat of the advertising genius 
        <br/>
        who came up with that one.
        <br/><br/>
        
        The Mayans came up with the concept of zero,
        <br/>
        The basis of all mathematical equations.
        <br/>
        The Aztecs mapped the stars,
        <br/>
        invented a solar calendar that’s still accurate today.
        <br/><br/>
        
        We are the smell of dried chile peppers and corn tortillas 
        <br/>
        rolling like mist across the valley,
        <br/>
        the pastel colors of desert sunsets blended over Toltec temples,
        <br/>
        the prayers on the lips of Santa Anna’s soldiers.
        <br/>
        We are the tears that fall from our eyes in the face of injustice.
        <br/>
        If you feel the need to commercialize our heritage,
        <br/>
        you can make a commercial out of that.
        <br/><br/>
