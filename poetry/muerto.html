    <h3>Muerto</h3>
    <p>The day abolita died, 
        <br/>
        my father cried like her baby.
        <br/>
        All the tios and tias were there.
        <br/>
        Triny brought tamales.
        <br/>
        The clouds were big and puffy.
        <br/>
        Chalky red, blue, and yellow.
        <br/>
        Like balls of cotton candy at the August fair.
        <br/>
        Like the flowers grandma planted in the backyard of her small house,
        <br/>
        next to the fence by the cinder alley.
        <br/> <br/>
        
        Dad died on a Friday.
        <br/>
        Alone in a hospital bed.
        <br/>
        Someone stole the am/fm radio,
        <br/>
        and they never did find his comforter.
        <br/>
        Aunt Mary called from Indiana.
        <br/>
        I called my children in San Antonio.
        <br/>
        The clouds were flat,
        <br/>
        gray with winter.
        <br/>
        And we cried. 
        <br/>
        Like babies.</p>
